Chevereto Extended
==================
Welcome to the Chevereto Extended project!<br>
This is the code for what will be Chevereto 2.0,<br>
which is a complete re-write of Chevereto in order<br>
to make it more expandable, easier to maintain,<br>
better code structuring, and modular.

Here's a list of a few new features:

  - **Framework design pattern** - The code is written with expansion in mind.

  - **Plug-in '*hooking*' and '*filtering*'** - Similar to how WordPress works, the new system makes it easy for plug-in developers to tie into the core and alter/filter how the system works.

  - **SQLite or MySQL database** - After careful consideration and planning, the new Chevereto will implement a database for much greater expansion performance and extended user control.<br>  It will be using PHP's PDO extension, which offers the choice of SQLite or MySQL databases as well as others!
  
  - **Administrative Panel** - It will come with an administrative panel and user system giving the owner control over how the site runs and functions as well as other options.

  - **More URL Shortening Services** - There's a LONG list of new URL shortening services that will be available and you can choose to use some of them or all of them if you like.
